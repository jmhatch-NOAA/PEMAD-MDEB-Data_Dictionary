## Standard Operating Procedure

### Naming convention for spatial tables in oracle database

NEFSC scientific survey strata are compiled in the oracle database under the MDEB_SPATIAL schema. All spatial tables are projected in North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). NEFSC scientific survey strata naming conventions are as follows:

|       *SCHEMA.PROJECTABBR_SURVEYCODE_STRATA*
| 
| For example, the Bottom Trawl Survey strata:
|       *MDEB_SPATIAL.SMIT_BTS_STRATA*
| 
| Surveys with associated substrata are named as follows:
|       *SCHEMA.SMIT_SURVEYCODE_SUBSTRATA*
| 
| Surveys with an associated point layer (ex. sample stations) are named as follows:
|       *SCHEMA.SMIT_SURVEYCODE_STATIONS*
| 
| Surveys with an associated line layer (ex. surveylines) are named as follows:
|       *SCHEMA.SMIT_SURVEYCODE_LINES*
| 
| Metadata tables for associated survey strata are named as follows:
|       *SCHEMA.SMIT_SURVEYCODE_META*
