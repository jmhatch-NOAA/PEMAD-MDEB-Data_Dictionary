# Connecting R and ArcGIS

You will need to install the R-ArcGIS Bridge for the appropriate version of R that you're using, which can be found [here](https://r.esri.com/bin/). Once downloaded, you will need to unzip and install the package in R from the local file. Alternatively, you can install from ESRI directly in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("arcgisbinding", repos = "<https://r.esri.com>", type = "win.binary") 
```

For more documentation of R-Bridge for ArcGIS, see [here](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/installation/). Also, you will need to install the ArcGIS metapackage, which is still in development and currently includes the `arcgislayers` and `arcgisutils` packages.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("R-ArcGIS/arcgis")
```

For updates, see [here](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/arcgis).

An example is presented below on how to pull data from ArcGIS online by using a feature layer or feature server url.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load libraries
library(arcgisbinding) 
arc.check_product() 
library(arcgislayers)
library(arcgisutils) 
library(ggplot2)

# connect to ArcGIS.com
arc.portal_connect(url =  "https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com", user = "", password = "") # enter ArcGIS.com username and password
arc.check_portal()

# create an example map of USA using REST API Layer:USA Counties
# provide feature server url and feature layer
feature_server_url <- "https://services2.arcgis.com/FiaPA4ga0iQKduv3/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb_Counties_v1/FeatureServer/0"

# create a feature layer object
data <- arc_open(feature_server_url)

# query the feature layer and return the layer as an sf (simple feature) object
sf_data <- arc_select(data)

# create map from sf object
USA_map <- ggplot(data = sf_data)+
            geom_sf(fill = "white")+ #fill color white
            coord_sf(xlim= c(-13951910,-7000000), ylim = c(1000000, 7000000)) #set map coordinates (in meters)
USA_map
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Map of the USA."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/USA_map.png")
```

# Connecting python and ArcGIS

This code is for connecting to arcgis.com via the ArcGIS API for python, refer to https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api for source code. Further documentation at https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/.

```{python, eval = FALSE, python.reticulate = FALSE}
# load libraries
import arcpy
import arcgis
from arcgis.gis import GIS
from arcgis.features import FeatureLayer
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# log into arcgis online
# see documentation for logging in with various authentication schemes 
# https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/guide/working-with-different-authentication-schemes/
user = "" # enter arcgis.com username
password = "" # enter arcgis.com password
portal = "https://noaa.maps.arcgis.com/"
gis = GIS(portal, user, password)

# alternatively, log in using ArcGIS Pro, if Pro is on system computer and is logged into the portal
gis = GIS("PRO")

# test arcis.com connection
if gis is not None and gis._portal.is_logged_in:
  print(f"Successfully logged in as: {gis.properties.user['username']}")
else:
  print("Login failed.")

# example map
# pull data from arcgis online using feature server url, from ArcGIS REST API
# in this example, taking the World Continents feature layer from Living Atlas 
item_url = "https://services.arcgis.com/P3ePLMYs2RVChkJx/arcgis/rest/services/World_Continents/FeatureServer/0"

# retrieve item from arcgis online
world_layer = FeatureLayer(item_url)

# query feature layer to return all data
world_features = world_layer.query(where="1=1")

# create a list to hold the geometries
geometries = []

# loop through features to extract geometries
for feature in world_features.features:
  geom = feature.geometry
  if geom['rings']:
    for ring in geom['rings']:
      polygon = Polygon(ring)
      geometries.append(polygon)

# create geopandas dataframe
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=geometries)

# create map using geopandas
fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
gdf.plot(ax=ax, color='#9bc04b', edgecolor='black') #set fill color and border color
plt.title('World Map') #set map title
ax.set_xticks([]) #remove tick marks
ax.set_yticks([])
ax.xaxis.set_ticklabels([]) #remove tick labels
ax.yaxis.set_ticklabels([])
plt.ylim(-9000000,20000000) #set limits of y axis 
plt.show()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="World map"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/World_map.png")
```
